                         Report of Demultiplexing Run

The overall table which tells us the number of each index pair appearances and their % appearance overall (rounded to 3 decimals) is in the file called index_pair_info.txt in the output folder 
There are 5 plots in the output folder: 
  1) Overall Distribution Piechart:	Overall_distribution.png
  2) Distribution of Matched Reads:	matched_distribution.png
  3) Distribution of Individual Indexes which Hopped:	hopped_index_global_distribution.png
  4) Top 20 Index-Pairs which hopped:	hopped20_index_pair_distribution.png
  5) Heatmap of Number of Appearance of each Read:	heatmap_index_pair_distribution.png

                         Overall Statistics

Total number of reads = 363246735
Total number of samples = 24

Overall matched samples % = 88.591
Overall unknown samples % = 11.245
